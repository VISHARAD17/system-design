# System-design

### Objectives of system design 
- `Practicality` :
- `Accuracy`:
- `Completeness` :
- `Efficient`:
- `Reliability`
- `Optimization`:
- `Scalable`

```
System Design helps us to achieve fault tolerence which is an ability of a software 
to continue working , even if its 1 or 2 componenets fails
```

### Advantages of System Design :
- Reduces the design cost of a product : by using already established design patterns and 
reusable components, we can lower the efforts to create a new software designs.
- Speedy software development process : Using frameworks and libraries speeds the 
development by providing pre-build functionalities, allowing developers to focus on main features.
- Saves overall time in SDLC : streamlined process and automation in SDLC leads to quicker and faster 
time to market
- Increases Efficiency and Consistency of a Programmer : familiar tools and methodologies enable
programmers to work more effectively
- Saves Resources: optimized workflow and shared resources minimize the need for redundant efforts
